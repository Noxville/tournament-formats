Tournament Format Quality Evaluator
-----------------------------------

The goal of this is to quantify the 'quality' of a tournament. What do we mean by quality?

* The better teams should, on average, place better
* Higher variance is a bad thing (if the best team (out of K teams) comes last 1 time, that is much worse than the Nth best team coming (N+1)th (K-1) times)
* Tournaments where teams end up tied in a position should be penalizing for failing to ordinaly rank those tied teams
